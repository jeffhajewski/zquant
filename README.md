# zquant

TurboQuant implemented in Zig.

An implementation of [TurboQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) (Zandieh, Daliri,
Hadian, Mirrokni — ICLR 2026): a data-oblivious vector quantizer with near-optimal
distortion rate, for vector search and LLM KV-cache compression.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the design and implementation plan.

## Status

Early. P0 (reference core) in progress.

## Building

Requires Zig 0.15.2.

```sh
zig build test
```

### macOS note

On this machine the Xcode 26 SDK ships a `libSystem.tbd` whose target list omits the
plain `arm64-macos` slice (it has `arm64e-macos` only), so linking against it fails on
Apple Silicon with a wall of `undefined symbol: _getcwd`-style errors. The Command Line
Tools SDK is unaffected. Either prefix builds:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools zig build test
```

or switch the active developer directory once, globally:

```sh
sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```
